Literature Survey

GANs:- Generative Adversarial Networks(Goodfellow et. al) are dubbed as one of
the coolest models in Machine Learning. Two neural networks contest with each
other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new
data with the same statistics as the training set. Many SOTA GAN models like
infoGAN, styleGAN, cycleGAN, have had a great influence in Machine Learning

Implementation
GANs:- GANs are basically two neural networks Generative network, which
generates candidates, and discriminative network, which evaluates them. The
generative model is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the
discriminator is a convolutional neural network. The generative network tries
to fool the discriminator network by producing images similar to input space.

Progress
GAns:- Initially to understand GANs, i tried implementing a GAN using only
numpy. This model performed quite well on the MNIST dataset with only 1
labelled image. But didn't work well with the full 10 labelled MNIST. This led
to implementation of a Deep Convolutional GAN(DCGAN). This model worked well
with Full MNIST dataset. But not quite well with Omniglot dataset due to
smaller latent space. Next tasks include implementing GANs that work with very
small dataset.
