# oneshot-MANN
Replication of results in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065v1.pdf

### Task Walkthrough
1. Build a LSTM model to do tasks similar to omniglot
2. Build a NTM with read/write heads to improve performance for one-shot learning
3. Implement the paper, i.e. build a Memory augmented Neural Network
4. Future progress- more work on memory use. Use GRU/peephole LSTM for controller task.

Tentative Deadline(Personal)
        May 6-May 8 ---> Build the LSTM model(all utility functions needed)(also try using a simple 				 siamese network)
        May 9-May 13 ---> Build the NTM model. Try MANN similarly(same structure for controller, 				  different method for writing into memory)
        May 13-May 20 ---> Implementing the paper.
