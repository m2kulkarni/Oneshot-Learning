# Few-shot Learning

### Task Walkthrough
1. Build a LSTM model to do tasks similar to omniglot
2. Build a NTM with read/write heads to improve performance for one-shot learning
3. Implement the paper, i.e. build a Memory augmented Neural Network
4. Future progress- more work on memory use. Use GRU/peephole LSTM for controller task.
